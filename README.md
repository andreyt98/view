## Movies and TV shows single-page-application (SPA)

This project was done with JavaScript, using 'The movie data base API (TMDB)' and Fetch API to retrieve data.
It's based on components and has a router to control what to show, based on the actual hash property of the location object.

All this, to introduce myself to how React kinda works!
