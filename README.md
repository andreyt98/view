## Movies and TV shows single-page-application (SPA)

This project was built with JavaScript, using 'The movie data base API (TMDB)' and Fetch API to retrieve data.
It's divided into components and has a router to render different views, based on the actual hash property of the location object.

All this, to dig deep into JavaScript, single page applications and, introduce myself to how React kinda works!
